**Summary**  
************   
Void Editor is AI integrated and powered with VSCode, which can use many existing AI models and is focused on privacy. Void is an open-source alternative to Cursor, which prevents developer code from being sent through a private backend. As a fork of VSCode, Void has all the same features and shortcuts while still adding quick edits, chat features, native tool use and more. With a smooth integration and full control over your data, Void is an up-and-coming star.

**Additional Resources**   
For the AI companion portion of our project, we have chosen to use Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 model. This is due to Claude having stronger logic, reasoning and agentic coding features, which makes it the most popular model for developers in the tech industry. We will be logging our interactions with Claude as per the project requirements to ensure that we are using the AI companion within the guidelines provided to us.
