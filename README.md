**Summary**  
************   
Void Editor is AI integrated and powered with VSCode, which can use many existing AI models and is focused on privacy. Void is an open-source alternative to Cursor, which prevents developer code from being sent through a private backend. As a fork of VSCode, Void has all the same features and shortcuts while still adding quick edits, chat features, native tool use and more. With a smooth integration and full control over your data, Void is an up-and-coming star.
